# Fastest Finger First Circuit âš¡

### Objectives

ðŸŽ¯ **Circuit Design**: Develop a Verilog-based design for the Fastest Finger Circuit, specifying the architecture, functionality, and logic involved in accurately                        measuring response times.

ðŸŽ¯ **Button Interface**: Implement an interface for multiple input buttons to simulate participant responses and trigger the LEDâ€™s/visual mechanism.

ðŸŽ¯**Display and Recording**: Design a system to identify and record the response times, potentially incorporating an output interface for displaying the fastest                                responder.

ðŸŽ¯ **Verification and Simulation**: Conduct rigorous simulations to verify the functionality and accuracy of the Fastest Finger Circuit design under various                                           conditions and participant responses.
